<div style="text-align:justify">
The Pokémon Go Project is a Go-based application that brings the world of Pokémon to life through three main modules: Pokedex, Pokebat, and Pokecat. The Pokedex acts as a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, allowing users to search, view, and manage detailed Pokémon information. Pokebat introduces a battle simulation system where players can pit Pokémon against each other, leveraging type effectiveness and customizable battle settings. Pokecat enables organizing and cataloging Pokémon by various attributes, with sorting, grouping, and export functionalities. Built with Go, the project ensures high performance, concurrency for parallel simulations, and simplicity, making it an engaging platform for Pokémon fans and Go developers alike.

### Overview
This application offers an interactive Pokémon experience through three main features: Pokedex, Pokebat, and Pokecat. The Pokedex serves as a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, allowing users to explore detailed information, search by attributes, and manage entries. Pokebat introduces a battle simulation system with customizable battles, type-effectiveness mechanics, and random encounters for exciting challenges. Pokecat enables organizing and cataloging Pokémon by attributes like type, region, and strength, with sorting and export capabilities. Leveraging Go’s performance and concurrency, the project delivers a seamless and engaging platform for Pokémon fans and developers.

### Installation :hammer_and_wrench:

1. **Download GO**:
    - Go to the [official GO download page](https://go.dev/dl/).
    - Download the installer for your operating system.

2. **Verify Installation**

After installation, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands to verify that GO is installed:

```sh
go version
```

3. **Install the Go Extension**
    - Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X on macOS).
    - Search for "Go" and install [the Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go).


4. **Install Go Tools**

When you open a .go file for the first time, VS Code will prompt you to install the Go tools (like gopls, dlv, etc.). Click Install All to set them up.

5. **Run the Go Project**

```sh
go run main.go
```
